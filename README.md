### Project Description
Pazhamchollu Diaries – Discover the World of Malayalam Proverbs

Pazhamchollu Diaries is a culturally immersive mini-game collection that invites players into a whimsical Kerala-inspired universe, where age-old Malayalam proverbs (pazhamchollukal) come alive through play. Guided by the theme “Discover the Pazhamchollu World,” the game transforms traditional wisdom into interactive challenges filled with humor, storytelling, and visual charm.

More than just sharing deeper meanings, Pazhamchollu Diaries rekindles a love for Malayalam folklore among the new generation—ensuring these timeless sayings are remembered, cherished, and passed on.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Pazhamchollu Diaries – Solving a Problem Nobody Knew They Didn’t Have

In a world overflowing with real issues—climate change, AI ethics, global pandemics—we decided to tackle something truly... irrelevant.

What if, we asked ourselves, Malayalam proverbs were in danger of being slightly less remembered by people who never cared in the first place?  
And thus, Pazhamchollu Diaries was born: a gloriously over-engineered solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.

🤷‍♂ The Non-Problem
- Nobody asked for it.  
- Nobody noticed it.  
- Nobody’s life was affected by it.  
But we fixed it anyway.

🎮 The Game
Three mini-games (more of them will be added in the near future). Countless pazhamchollus. Zero impact on global affairs.  
Play it to feel culturally superior while doing absolutely nothing useful.

🧠 The Vision
We could’ve built a rocket. Solved traffic. Cured boredom.  
Instead, we made a game about proverbs. Because why not?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
🥭 Pazhamchollu Diaries
You didn’t ask for it. But you’ll love it anyway.

🤷‍♀ The Solution Nobody Needed
We saw a gap in the market.  
Actually… we imagined one.  
Nobody demanded a game based on Malayalam proverbs. But we built it anyway—because why not?

Pazhamchollu Diaries is a whimsical tribute to Kerala’s timeless pazhamchollukal, reimagined as mini-games that are equal parts hilarious and oddly profound
🎮 What’s Inside (So Far)
We’ve launched with two proverb-powered mini-games:
- 🐘 Aadi Thettiyāl Āṇayum Veezhum – Dodge your downfall in a game of timing and wit.  
- 🐍 Pokkunakolli Purathu – Brave the unknown, but beware what lurks beyond.
- 🐸 Thavala Karanjall Mazha Peyum- coincidence mistaken for causation

Each game turns age-old wisdom into bite-sized fun.
🚀 What’s Coming
More pazhamchollu madness is on the way.  
New mini-games. New proverbs. New ways to laugh at life’s strange truths.
🧠 Why Play?
Because culture is cooler when it’s interactive.  
Because pazhamchollukal deserve their own cinematic universe.  
Because you’re curious. Admit it.
